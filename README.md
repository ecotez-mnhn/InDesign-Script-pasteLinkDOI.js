# InDesign-Script-pasteLinkDOI.js
This script let you copy a DOI on internet and paste and link it in via a simple touch in InDesign

The copied DOI can have the following formats:
DOI: 10.5252/geodiversitas2022v44a33
http://dx.doi.org/10.5252/geodiversitas2022v44a33
https://dx.doi.org/10.5252/geodiversitas2022v44a33

It also deletes the spaces included in the address, and the potential last dot '.' (when the DOI is placed at the end of a sentence).

It pastes and links the DOI in the following format:

https://doi.org/10.5252/geodiversitas2022v44a33

That is the format recommended by CrossREF, and should then be used.
